I found this information at: https://help.github.com/en/articles/changing-a-commit-message

I also had trouble exiting the commit message editing page so I found another source to help me exit. The link to this site is: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9171356/how-do-i-exit-from-the-text-window-in-git
Task 7
------
First I did: git log --oneline, which showed me the list of all the commits
I found out how to do this at :https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9171356/how-do-i-exit-from-the-text-window-in-git
Then I looked up how to search for specific git log commit messages and found answers at :https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7124914/how-to-search-a-git-repository-by-commit-message
I then input: git log --all --grep'--no mouse'
It then output this commit SHA and commit message: commit c7e86ad4f1061b0cad9f64a6c9ad26f386bc1168

 Git is pretty cool
 Hopefully our last change....
+I hope I can do Task 8...

 
Task 9
------
I removed the file by using the basic command: rm mistake.txt. I then commited this new change. I knew this command because I have been using it to remove all my previous mistakes I have made when attempting to do this lab. This command can also be found on one of the handouts given to us.
