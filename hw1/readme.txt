I am using Python3.

---------------------------

To run the Hello World program I type:
python3 Hello_World.py

My program says hello and then asks for the users name.
It then says it nice to meet the user using the name inputed.
Then it goes on to ask how old the user is, where they live, where they would like to travel to, and what their hobbies are.
It outputs all this information in a nice paragraph that shows interest.
Then it asks for the users number.
Lastly it ends with a snarky comment about actually calling the user or not with the number inputed by the user.

----------------------------------------

To run the converter program I type:
python3 converter.py

This program simply states what it does, asks the user for a temperature in fahrenheit, and then calculates it into celsius with the formula I coded.
It then prints the conversion equivalence statement 5 times.

---------------------------------------

To run the Unit conversion program I type:
python3 unit_conversion.py

My program converts us dollars to euros.
It first prints a statement of what it does.
Then it prompts the user for an input in the form of US currency.
It then runs the formula I coded and prints out a statement that shows the conversion equivalence.

-----------------------------------------

To run the Slope program I type:
python3 slope.py

My program prints a statement describing what it will do first.
Then it prompts the user to input how many numbers they want to be added together.
Then it asks one at a time for the user to enter the numbers and adds each one to the rest.
It then prints out a statement that includes how many numbers the user wanted to add together, and the sum of them.

-----------------------------------------

To run the Fibonacci Sequence program I type:
python fib_sequence.py

My program first prints a statement describing what it will do.
Then it prompts the user to input the index value of the number in the fibonacci sequence they would like to know the actual value of.
Then it runs an equation to compute that number and prints out the answer.


------------------------------------------

To run the change program I type:
python3 change.py

My program takes the users input of how much change they want to recieve. 
Then, it divides the change, starting with the value of a quarter, to see how many will go into it. 
It then saves that number with the name of the coin.
At the end it adds up all the numbers saved with the names of coins to get the total amount of coins used.
It then prints out the statesment explaining how many total and how many of each coin is needed to return the customer's desired amount of change.
