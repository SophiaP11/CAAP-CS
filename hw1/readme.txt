I am using Python3.

To run the change program I type:
python3 change.py

My program takes the users input of how much change they want to recieve. 
Then, it divides the change, starting with the value of a quarter, to see how many will go into it. 
It then saves that number with the name of the coin.
At the end it adds up all the numbers saved with the names of coins to get the total amount of coins used.
It then prints out the statesment explaining how many total and how many of each coin is needed to return the customer's desired amount of change.
