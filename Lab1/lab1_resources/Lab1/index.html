                    <p>Strawbery Fields Forever was founded by Sophia Pegues, after a tramatic experience she had with store-bought strawberries. Sophia is a student at the University of Chicago, but dedicates her precious time trying to prevent others from experiencing the same thing she did. When asked what she sees the future of Strawberry Fields Forver as, Sophia replied:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"I hope to see it grow and eventually become a platform for all fruit lovers to use to find local produce. We might have to change the name though...but thats an issue for a later time. For now I would just be happy seeing more and more strawberry lovers using and appreciating this webiste."</p></blockquote>
                <p>We sure do love our owner, and we hope you do too. Feel free to show your appreciation for her mission by donating to Strawberry Fields Forever. If you have any questions about this process don't hesitate to email us at <a href="mailto:strawberryfieldsforever@gmail.com">strawberryfieldsforever@gmail.com</a>.</p>
